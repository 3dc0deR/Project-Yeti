# Project-Yeti

This project comes in as a aid during disaster management. During disasters one of the biggest challenge faced by victims is no availibility of power and cellular networks.

We try to solve the problem by creating a series of raspberry pi nodes situated at regular intervals which are interconnected with one another in a relay fashion and can transmit data from the topmost node to the bottomost node by relaying. With this very simple concept it is possible to transmit a message from any node to the rescue team which is near the bottommost node. A victim can use the emergency device to send an SOS signal by simply pressing a button, and the details about him and his location would be sent to the rescue team which can come to his/her aid. Since the implementation is independent of cellular networks, it would work even when cellular network is down. Also the victims can use their smartphone and connect to the nearest raspberry pi node and send an SOS signal from the app.

It can be implemented at various places like tunnels, sewers, floods, mountains etc.
